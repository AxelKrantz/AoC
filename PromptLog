Prompt 3:
Also, PLEASE add a note about warning me if you belive that we are starting to use way to many tokens. I dont want to drain my companys account

Prompt 4:
Alright, lets go for solving the first task of 2015. https://adventofcode.com/2015

Prompt 5:
Go ahead, but also figure out how to get the puzzle inputs

Prompt 6:
Before we do anything else: Create a file in the repo named "PromptLog" where we keep a full of log what I write to you, including previous messages and this as well. This must be updated first after EVERY prompt from me. You are never allowed to delete from this file, only append

Prompt 7:
Install dependencies and then tell me what you need to be able to login and get the AOC pussle inputs as well as submit the results after you have ran the coded solution

Prompt 8:
You may access the internet ONLY to speak to the adventofcode website. Here is my session cookie 53616c7465645f5f6f6de84b00c8b4a55491632854f25e59bb7257e190ce2f0ca5ad0d44f74e53cc6e332919fc1e42862ec7aae46e4fa57cefafba69943d46c7

Prompt 9:
I would like to run the command that you suggested above and you may install dependencies

Prompt 10:
next steps sound good

Prompt 11:
go

Prompt 12:
do 1

Prompt 13:
Do you have the proper tooling to complete day 2-5 without asking me any more questions?

Prompt 14:
Go ahead, dont disturb me unless it has to do with token usage. I basically want your next  message to be saying "Jobs done" when day 2-5 are finished.

Prompt 15:
Have you submitted them?

Prompt 16:

Do day 6-10

Prompt 19:
Go to 2024 and complete day 1-5. You are allowed to run the commands for fetching the data and submitting the data using the session cookie

Prompt 20:
How do I give you blanket permission to make http-calls to the advent of code website?

Prompt 21:
Alright lets create a tiny script that you are to call before every network call that gives "2" as input when the prompt comes up

Prompt 22:
go ahead

Prompt 23:
Alright do one more day of the AoC 2024. Also, make sure you have updated the promptlog with the latest prompts

Prompt 24:
Alright here is what we are going to do. You are going to create a tiny script that calls any internet address that you supplies it with and delivers the results back to you. Then when you need to query the advent of code website you can just send the adress to this little script and it can handle the connection to the internet so you no longer have to ask for my permission

Prompt 25:
Ok. Create a tiny script that contacts the internet on any adress that you supply it with

Prompt 26:
lame

Prompt 27:
go ahead

Prompt 28:
submit!

Prompt 29:
Keep going for the rest of 2024. But also, do one request to fetch the data, solve it, then one request to submit the data so the times I have to answer to you is more spread out

Prompt 30:
You should continue on day 8 and forward until the end of 2024, but figure out how to minimize the questions you have to ask me. Can you fetch the task and input data for all the days in one big script for example?

Prompt 31:
Sounds good, go ahead

Prompt 32:
Yes, solve all the days that you already have downloaded data for, no need to ask me abou tit

Prompt 33:
Dont submit the answers for this day yet, do all the tests that you have the data for then ask for sending in the responses all in one command

Prompt 34:
Sounds good

Prompt 35:
Go ahead

Prompt 36:
Nice, keep going

Prompt 37:
No checkpoints, just power through until the final day

Prompt 38:
alright submit answers and make sure you have correct results before we continue

Prompt 39:
Whats the cutoff date on your training data?

Prompt 40:
